Im going to use openAI,s api at gpt 4.0 or similar. I already have the key set at root level in my .env.local file

The project is at cd /users/cordo/documents/corradoco_web btw. 
Word by word response would be fancy. 
Yea some basic rate limiting. After we hit like 10 messages it could say "you've hit the limit of this chat - to find out more please schedule a call" and then that button will appear or something. but how does this work after they refresh the page? If this is insanely complicated then we can leave out for now. 
It should be a consultative expert that knows its audience who are a frustrated group of people in a company trying to figure out how to get AI into their systems. 

In terms of domain knowledge it should know that we like to try and build result driven AI chat bots instead of just vague bots. these results are driven through integration with data sources they currently have instead of building completely new systems. We also use low code tools like n8n and zapier to integrate systems neatly so the AI has good data to work with. If raw AI-less automation is what they need then we can deliver that too. 

If they are wondering about if a certain bot can work a certain way then I would want it to respond like claude would. but responses should stay fairly short and to the point. if it needs more infomraiton about how their systems work before giving an answer it should ask follow up questions or once a certain point is reached it shoudl recommend we schedule a call and then that button should appear. 

For now the context about me should simply be that we serve mid sized companies. we've built RAG based chatbots with domain knowledge we were founded this year in 2025. the system should know todays date!! sometimes bots dont so this is important. 

In terms of when to schedule the call it shoudl ask like a front desk lady almost that has access to the internet. The front desk lady ultimatly has to push the call to the "project manager": or whatever at a logical point in the conversation. If they respond to the "what was your idea" question - the chat bot should ask one inteligent question and once they provide an answer it should either proceed to gather better context if it feels right or go ahead and aks to scheudle the call. 

Oh great point. if it asks for pricing use the value of the autoamtion. say something like - "we make sure you have a return on investment. if we can automate a process 100% without human input and the value add between hours saved and other factors is say 100,000 - this autoamtion after all API costs, development costs etc can usually fall at about 1/4 of the value of the automation. this definetly isnt a final figure but a good measure for you to decide if you'd like to proceed. sometimes we also offer success first periods where we only charge after succesfull implementation. 

Yea if they ask supar vague questions this is where the consulatant tone can drop a bit and they can be more human - Are you really looking to automate or are you just playing around. go spend groks API tokens if thats what you want!! idk - something funny. 

Yea I suppose the first response should vary mostly on outliers of one of the input fields. Like if its a 40 hour saving automation then they should be like wow - what IDea is this that could completley replace an employee! this seems like an amazing opportunity for automation) or if they say it impacts 2 employess it would be more subtle of a response. - still positive just subtle. If they say the salary of the employee is 250k plus then it should respond with hesitation like "in general the market values employees accuratly and if they make over 200k im hesitent that we could automate these super high value tasks. AI isnt superhuman yet and still needs clean data. not to say this is impossible but we should proceed with caution " want to schedule a call" this needs to be dynamic based on the input varibales. make sense? yes include the dollar figure

No schedule a call button will just be the name and email input button we already have on the site. 

If they fill out the schedule a call button then yes we should log this discussion with the button and store somewhere. this is where Im confused because right now we are just on localhost but once we get to supabase we will need to set this up. 

wow. hope you got all of that. How should proceed one step at a time? this is a lot so want to make sure we do it correctly by going slowly one small step - complete - I verify - then next step.
